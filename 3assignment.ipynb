    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating population parameters based on sample data. In many real-world scenarios, it is often impractical or impossible to collect data from an entire population. Instead, researchers or analysts take a sample from the population and use statistical methods to make inferences and estimate unknown population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common types of estimation in statistics: point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate:\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that serves as the best guess or approximation of an unknown population parameter based on sample data. It is a single data point calculated from the sample that is used to estimate the corresponding parameter of the entire population.\n",
    "For example, let's say we are interested in estimating the average height of all students in a school. We take a random sample of 100 students and calculate the mean height of this sample. This mean height value is a point estimate of the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "While point estimates provide a straightforward and simple way to estimate population parameters, they do not convey information about the uncertainty associated with the estimate. For this reason, interval estimates are often used in conjunction with point estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate:\n",
    "An interval estimate, also known as a confidence interval, provides a range of values within which the unknown population parameter is likely to fall, along with a level of confidence associated with this estimate.\n",
    "Confidence intervals are constructed around the point estimate and are expressed as a range with an upper and lower bound. The level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval) indicates the probability that the true population parameter lies within the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the previous example, instead of providing a single value as the estimate of the average height, we might calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average height based on the sample data. The confidence interval might be, for instance, 165 cm to 170 cm. This means that we are 95% confident that the true average height of all students in the school lies within this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of interval estimates allows us to convey the uncertainty associated with our estimates, as well as providing a range within which the true population parameter is likely to exist. A higher confidence level (e.g., 99%) results in a wider interval, providing a more conservative estimate with a higher degree of certainty. Conversely, a lower confidence level (e.g., 90%) leads to a narrower interval, providing a less conservative estimate with a lower degree of certainty."

    "The process of hypothesis testing involves the following steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "Compute the Test Statistic: The test statistic is a numerical measure calculated from the sample data that quantifies the discrepancy between the sample and the null hypothesis. It depends on the type of hypothesis test being conducted.\n",

    "\n",
    "Make a Decision: Compare the test statistic to the critical region.

    "   To estimate the population mean number of ads watched by viewers during a TV program with a 99% confidence interval, we can use the formula for the confidence interval for the population mean (μ) based on the t-distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = sample mean ± (critical value) * (standard error)\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value depends on the chosen confidence level and the degrees of freedom (df), which is equal to the sample size minus 1. For a 99% confidence level, the critical value for a two-tailed test (to capture 99% of the distribution's probability) with df = 49 (50 - 1) is approximately 2.680 (you can find this value using a t-table or statistical software).\n",

    "The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample mean and is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Error = sample standard deviation / √(sample size)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval\n",
    "lower_bound = sample_mean - (critical_value * standard_error)\n",

    "In this example, the 99% confidence interval for the population mean number of ads watched is estimated to be approximately 3.69 to 4.31. This means that we are 99% confident that the true population mean number of ads watched falls within this range based on the sample data. \n",
